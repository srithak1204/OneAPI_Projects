## cnn_animals.ipynb
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying images of animals. The goal is to accurately identify different animal species from input images using deep learning techniques.
### features
- **Animal Species Classification:** The CNN is capable of accurately classifying images of various animal species, including cats,dogs and pandas.

- **Multi-Class Classification:** The model is trained to classify images into different categories, allowing it to distinguish between cats, dogs, and pandas.

- **Customizable:** The project is designed to be adaptable to different datasets, making it easy to extend the classification capabilities to include additional animal categories.
### Data
The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of images of various animal species. You can find the dataset in the `animals.zip` file. Ensure the dataset is appropriately labeled for optimal results.

## Model Architecture
The CNN architecture used for this project consists of multiple convolutional and pooling layers, followed by fully connected layers. The details of the model architecture can be found in the notebook.
### Results
