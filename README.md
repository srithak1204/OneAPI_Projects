## cnn_animals.ipynb
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying images of animals. The goal is to accurately identify different animal species from input images using deep learning techniques.
### features
- **Animal Species Classification:** The CNN is capable of accurately classifying images of various animal species, including cats,dogs and pandas.

- **Multi-Class Classification:** The model is trained to classify images into different categories, allowing it to distinguish between cats, dogs, and pandas.

- **Customizable:** The project is designed to be adaptable to different datasets, making it easy to extend the classification capabilities to include additional animal categories.
- **Modular Architecture:** The codebase is organized with a modular structure, enabling developers to modify and extend the model architecture, dataset, and other components easily.
